*Video timings script
*Version - 3.0
*********************

This is the center screen script for adjusting your picture with pi2scart or pi2jamma.

You have to adjust two resolution. One for 320 and one for 1600 resolution.

First adjust the 320 resolution.

Execute scripts set_video.sh to center your screen for 320 resolution:

startup retropie, press F4 to exit to shell. Type then 
cd retropie_pi2jamma_pi2scart
cd center_screen_script
./set_video.sh

- Step 1 : Input timings

Use option I, L or B to input timings. 

- Step 2 : Type Q for viewing the test image. Type Q to exit test image viewer

- Step 3 : Use Arrow to adjust screen. Check with Q test image (exit with Q)
           and adjust again with arrow key until screen is centered.

- Step 4 : Save timings with Option S for later use. 

- Step 5 : Use Option 1 to carry this resolution to emulationstation 
           runcommand-onstart.sh and runcommand-onend.sh script 
           in /opt/retropie/configs/all script
  
- Step 6 : X for Exit

I recommend to use ssh connection for adjusting the 1600 resolution since 
the fonts are barely readible.
